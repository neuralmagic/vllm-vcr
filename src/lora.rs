//! LoRA adapter bookkeeping for the mock engine.
//!
//! The frontend owns the `/v1/load_lora_adapter` HTTP surface; it relays each load/unload to
//! us as an `add_lora`/`remove_lora` engine-core utility call, and stamps the chosen adapter
//! onto every `EngineCoreRequest.lora_request` it forwards. Our job on this side is to:
//!
//!   1. answer those utility calls with a truthful `bool` (so the frontend's load/unload
//!      endpoints succeed),
//!   2. cap how many *distinct* adapters share the running batch (vLLM's `--max-loras`), and
//!   3. let the engine count per-adapter running/waiting requests for the
//!      `running_lora_adapters` / `waiting_lora_adapters` scheduler stats, which the frontend
//!      turns into the `vllm:lora_requests_info` gauge.
//!
//! The counting itself lives on the engine (it reads the running batch and waiting queue);
//! this module owns only the loaded-adapter set and the slot cap.
