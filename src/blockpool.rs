//! The unified KV-cache block pool: prefix-cache accounting, physical block-slot
//! allocation, and KV-cache event generation, all from one place.
//!
//! This mirrors vLLM's `v1/core/block_pool.py`, which couples the same three concerns:
//! it tracks which content blocks are cached, hands out physical slot ids, measures how
//! much of an incoming prompt is already cached (the prefix hit), and emits the
//! `BlockStored` / `BlockRemoved` / `AllBlocksCleared` events that the llm-d cache-aware
//! router consumes over ZMQ.
//!
//! Why one struct for all three: the physical slot id IS the unit the data plane pages
//! over NIXL (`addr = pool_base + block_id * block_bytes`), the unit the router indexes
//! (`remote_block_ids`), and the unit eviction frees. Splitting them would mean keeping
//! three id spaces in sync; vLLM doesn't, and neither do we.
//!
//! ## Hashing vs the router
//!
//! The router (`llm-d-kv-cache`) does NOT trust our `block_hashes`: it re-hashes the
//! `token_ids` itself (FNV-64a over canonical CBOR) to build its prefix tree. So our
//! engine-side hash only has to be *stable per content* so that a later `BlockRemoved`
//! resolves back to the block a `BlockStored` introduced, and so a child block's
//! `parent_block_hash` equals the hash we already emitted for its parent. A chained FNV
//! gives us exactly that, cheaply, with no need to reproduce vLLM's (pickle-based,
//! per-process-random-seeded, deliberately non-reproducible) sha256 scheme.
//!
//! ```text
//!   prompt tokens ──chunk by block_size──▶ [blk0][blk1][blk2] (partial tail dropped)
//!         hash:  h0 = H(NONE, blk0)
//!                h1 = H(h0,   blk1)
//!                h2 = H(h1,   blk2)
//!   prefix hit = longest leading run already in `cached`; the rest are stored.
//! ```
